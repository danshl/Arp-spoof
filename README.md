# Arp-spoof
ARP spoofing is a deceptive technique used to manipulate the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables in a network, allowing an attacker to intercept, modify, or block network traffic. 

As part of our university project, we developed an attack enabling
* Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) scenarios. This entails intercepting and altering communications between devices, potentially leading to further exploits like DNS spoofing or file tampering.
 
* Additionally, ARP spoofing can be leveraged to disconnect specific devices from the network by spoofing the MAC address of the router's DEFAULTGETWAY. 

*Furthermore, it can disrupt the entire network by identifying and spoofing the MAC addresses of all devices, causing widespread communication failures.
